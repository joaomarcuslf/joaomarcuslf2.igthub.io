In the past, it was quite common for people to share their setups, and I particularly loved reading these kinds of posts, until I decided to configure my own setup. I built it on top of `oh-my-zsh` with some plugins and an adaptation of one of its very popular themes. And since I'm great at following trends that have already faded, I decided to write a post explaining the step-by-step process of how I set up my development environment.

<blockquote class="is-family-monospace">
<strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <br />
I tried to make the setup work on all Unix-like systems. On those I tested (Manjaro, Fedora, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Mac, Raspberry Pi), I managed without major difficulties, at most adapting a step to the environment used.
</blockquote>

### Pre-Steps

Some steps could not be added to the setup because they are environment-specific. Let’s look at them individually.

#### Homebrew (Mac)

Project link: [Site](https://brew.sh/)

This section is specific to Mac; if you're on Linux, you can skip it.

<pre class="is-hljs">
  <code class="bash">
  /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
  </code>
</pre>

#### Fira Code

Project link: [Github](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Installing)

This is one of my favorite fonts, and I usually use it both in the terminal and in the text editor.

On Mac, you need to have Brew:

<pre class="is-hljs">
  <code class="bash">
  brew tap homebrew/cask-fonts
  brew install --cask font-fira-code
  </code>
</pre>

On the Linux systems I used:

<pre class="is-hljs">
  <code class="bash">
  // Ubuntu / Linux Mint
  sudo apt install fonts-firacode

  // Manjaro
  sudo pacman -S fira-code-fonts

  // Fedora
  sudo dnf install fira-code-fonts
  </code>
</pre>

For other cases, check the repository at the top of this section.

#### Hyper

Project link: [Site](https://hyper.is/)

Hyper is a terminal that works on both Linux and Mac, so I opt for it since I can keep my terminal configs easily shared. Just click the link, and it will show the download option.

#### Git-extras

Project link: [Github](https://github.com/tj/git-extras/blob/master/Installation.md)

A small Git dependency, it is important for some `zsh` plugins.

Some commands to speed things up. If your OS is not listed here, check the repository at the top of this section.

<pre class="is-hljs">
  <code class="bash">
  // Mac
  brew install git-extras

  // Ubuntu / Linux Mint
  sudo apt install git-extras

  // Manjaro
  sudo pacman -S git-extras

  // Fedora
  sudo dnf install git-extras
  </code>
</pre>

#### ZSH

Project link: [Github](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH#how-to-install-zsh-on-many-platforms)

Zsh is a replacement for `bash` widely used in development environments. I chose to use it as I can easily share my terminal configs. Just click the link for the download option.

<pre class="is-hljs">
  <code class="bash">
  // Mac
  brew install zsh

  // Ubuntu / Linux Mint
  sudo apt install zsh

  // Manjaro
  sudo pacman -S zsh

  // Fedora
  sudo dnf install zsh
  </code>
</pre>

Verify everything is working with the command: `zsh --version`. If successful, set ZSH as the default shell and restart the terminal.

<pre class="is-hljs">
  <code class="bash">
  chsh -s $(which zsh)
  </code>
</pre>

If it still doesn't work, try restarting your environment and follow some answers [in this thread](https://askubuntu.com/questions/131823/how-to-make-zsh-the-default-shell).

### Dotfiles

Project link: [Github](https://github.com/joaomarcuslf/dotfiles/)

#### Initial Commands

<pre class="is-hljs">
  <code class="bash">
  cd ~
  git clone https://github.com/joaomarcuslf/dotfiles/

  // Wait for the Git clone to finish

  cd dotfiles

  // Make the script.sh executable
  sudo chmod +x start.sh
  ./start.sh
  </code>
</pre>

After running this, you will be prompted to install some packages. Respond `y` for each, or `n` if uninterested.

/>

Now you have everything configured and ZSH plugins installed.

You can find shortcuts I created to type less in the [alias](https://github.com/joaomarcuslf/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_aliases) section.

### 2023-09-04 Update

I also created a script called `git-profile` to automate Git and SSH configuration handling. To ensure it’s installed, follow this terminal step-by-step:

<pre class="is-hljs">
  <code class="bash">
  cd ~
  cd dotfiles
  git pull

  refresh

  cat ~/scripts/git-profile.js
  </code>
</pre>
...
