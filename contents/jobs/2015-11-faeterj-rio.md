I worked in academic applications in order to facilitate the teaching of subjects in the area of computing in colleges, using HTML / CSS and JavaScript.

I also worked using various Agile practices such as Kanban and Daily meetings, and applied XP and Scrum during the projects and Github to keep the project versioned and Open Source.
