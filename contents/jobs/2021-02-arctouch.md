ArcTouch is an international company oriented toward providing other companies with human resources.

One of the projects I dedicated a significant amount of time to was a Cloud Computing Application. This project, which utilized Goland, MongoDB, RabbitMQ, and gRPC, integrated multiple Back-end services to provide Real-Time information about the assets. The React.js Front-end allowed access to this information and the ability to send signals. Additionally, we developed UI tools for the Data Science team to analyze and send Cloud commands to each service.

Another project I worked on was related to providing HTML5 Banners following accessibility directives, Mobile Applications with React Native, and Multi-language applications.

I also worked on developing a React Native Mobile App, which used Event-driven communication to integrate a web app inside.

I've dealt with multiple clients from different parts of the world with different time zones and languages, which helped me improve my English speaking and problem-solving skills.
