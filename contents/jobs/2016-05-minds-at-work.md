Minds at Work is a consultant-style company, meaning I have worked with diverse languages and on diverse projects.

One that I worked on longer was a facial recognition application using AngularJS and Kendo for the front end and C#/DotNet for the back end.

Another that I worked on used Java/Spring for the back, and Vanilla Javascript for the Front-end; this application displayed a Tree visualization of Machines connected to the network, so an Admin could manage them remotely.

I also worked with agile Scrum practices using Kanban; I used Jenkins for Continuous integration, using Gulp.js for Front-end processes and Mercurial / HG for versioning, in multidisciplinary teams for projects in different areas.
