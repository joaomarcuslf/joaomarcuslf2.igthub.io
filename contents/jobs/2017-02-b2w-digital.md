B2W was the biggest E-commerce company in Latin America. It divided its Engineering chapter into each stage of customer E-commerce. Its e-commerce platform was a white-label application that adapted itself for the three major brands that B2W managed.

I participate in projects in several stages of E-Commerce, using JavaScript to develop universal and responsive applications with React and React Native for the front end and Node.js and MongoDB for the Back End.

I also work with AWS services such as Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, and S3, Git, continuous deployment with Gitlab and Bamboo pipeline, and Agile practices such as scrum.
