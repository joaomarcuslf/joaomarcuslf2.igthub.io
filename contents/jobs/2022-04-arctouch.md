After some time, I got promoted to Master Software Engineer (Staff Level), which meant my responsibilities expanded beyond my previous role as a Senior Software Engineer.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have taken on Tech Lead roles and contribute to the strategic development path for projects, and teams, working closely with managers to plan and chart strategies. I collaborate with the management team to identify areas of improvement and growth opportunities for the team members.

Mentorship has been a significant focus of my work. Through regular one-on-one sessions and group mentorship programs, I am helping them navigate challenges and equipping them with the tools they need to succeed.

I had to adapt to this role while still coding a lot, and I have been able to balance both roles. Most of the time, I worked in this role with Golang, React.js, and AWS. I have also worked closely with the DevOps team to improve our CI/CD pipelines and our code quality and security.
