During this period, I worked as a freelancer, developing websites and web applications for local clients in Brazil, using mostly Wordpress, jQuery, Ruby on Rails later.

Althought I'm not actively looking for new clients, I still hive some support for old clients, which include Wordpress, Javascript, and Ruby on Rails projects.
