In Working Minds, I've worked in different roles. Since it's a consultant-style company, each project required a different approach and role from me.

One of my notable projects was a Full Stack Application, using Ruby on Rails for the back end and React.js for the front end, where I leveraged my technical skills to develop an E-commerce platform for customers and an Admin portal for event scheduling.

Another one, I worked as a tech leader for an Ionic/Angular mobile app used by a private healthcare provider. This app required many integrations with different APIs and dealt with a lot of legacy code.
